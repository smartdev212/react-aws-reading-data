I probably liked it more the second time. Still need to read 1984 again to compare.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>The original dystopian novel. Orwell was a fan and claimed it inspired him to write 1984.<br/><br/>I haven't read 1984 since high school, but what I appreciated about We more than 1984 was that it's less about an authoritarian government and more about a society that puts utility, rational behavior, and data as the ultimate means to advance society. The government in We is way less sinister than 1984 and you could really even argue that it's ultimate goal was the flourishing of the people under its rule. It's easy to denounce the overreach and crimes of Big Brother, but in a culture driven by rapidly advancing knowledge and sheer amounts of data, are we as willing to admit to ourselves that those will ultimately fail as our saviors as well?<br/><br/>Also, while it made parts of this book tough to follow, the jagged, frantic writing in parts really works well.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

(Side note: Goodreads needs to handle rereads better. And by ""better"" I mean ""at all""). I could probably read this every year and still love it. The scope of this book is breathtaking to have been written by a single individual. It's hard to imagine a world in which Dostoevsky's piercing insight into humanity isn't relevant.<br/><br/>The thing I wish I knew about this book while reading it last year is that the plot is subservient to the characters. Not necessarily that it's less important or any less interesting, but Dostoevsky spends the first 200ish pages largely on character development. (I also wish I'd read about how Russian names work because it feels like there's 30 characters immediately, but there's really like 6 and they're all calling each other 5 different things). Rereading this, I realized how unbelievably well and distinctly Dostoevsky voices his characters, which is huge with the overall message and themes in Brothers Karamazov.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

So often this kind of stuff tries hook you with emotions and preys on a desire to know juicy details (looking at you, Serial Season 1). <br/><br/>Capote does a great job of holding both the senselessness and harrowing nature of the murder and the humanity of the perpetrators without downplaying either.

Stories about belonging, home, and motherhood have been told, and will continue to be told, for millennia. Will we continue to tell stories about workaholic bosses and tech companies in Silicon Valley? (I hope not) <br/><br/>The last 20ish% felt way too rushed compared to the first 80%.

And the culture he identifies as human is one in which we do not have to lie about what we are in relationship to our environment; a culture that insists upon a recognition of mortality and fallibility, of limit, of mutual indebtedness for our nurture and psychological growth, of the inaccessibility of our souls to one another and of the gratuitous and creative nature of what we say to one another. His fictions tell us, with intensifying urgency, that this culture is more at risk than we might have thought, that the restless concerns of secular and instrumentalist thinking are fast eroding it, so that we may wake up and discover we no longer know how to respond with either respect or compassion to each other, and so have literally nothing to say""<br/><br/>This is a dense book and a parts of it went way over my head, but really does a fantastic job of getting to the core of why Dostoevsky's ideas will always be relevant.

I had to restart a couple of them multiple times after realizing my mind wandered for a few sentences and was completely lost.<br/><br/>But they are very good. I think the best part of Marilynne Robinson's writing is that she doesn't really make assumptions about the topic she's writing about. Most writers you could probably assume, based on your knowledge of who they are, what their ultimate point about a topic would be. That only partially works with her. Most times she ends up in the general vicinity of where you think she'd go, but often takes a different path to get there, or ends up slightly left or right where you think she'd land.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

(The chapter on the one author I HAD read, Vladimir Nabokov, was unbelievably spot-on though).<br/><br/>Apart from those 2 things, this book was great. Karr really understands the way humanity derives both meaning and connection from personal narrative, both through telling one's own and hearing other people tell theirs. She also addresses the difficulty and almost universal phenomena of misremembering and reinterpreting, feeling shame from the uglier parts, and the feeling of inadequacy when comparing yourself to others; all things that anybody, memoirist or not, can relate to.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

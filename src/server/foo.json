    "description": "Her name is on everyone's lips, but can she help it if she was born rich and famous? Here's a bird's eye view of the fast, fun world of Paris Hilton, packed with enough photos, advice and inside scoop to help anyone become an heiress and live a privileged life. Socialite, fashion icon, television and movie star, recording artist and just plain celebrity: Twenty-two year old Paris Hilton is the great granddaughter of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and is estimated to be worth USD30 million. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world first became aware of Paris Hilton through a Vanity Fair profile in 2000. Since then, she has graced the pages of countless magazines, newspapers, and tabloids; modeled on the runways of top designers; appeared on television shows as herself ('Saturday Night Live', MTV Music Awards) and as fictional characters (the new Sky One show 'Las Vegas'); had small parts in movies like 'The Cat in the Hat', 'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' and the upcoming 'The Hillz'; has begun work on an album; and starred in a hit reality series, 'The Simple Life' (shown here on Channel 4). She has been romantically linked with current boyfriend Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys, Rick Solomon (of the notorious sex tape), and Deryck Whibley of Sum 41.",

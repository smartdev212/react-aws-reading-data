Still need to read 1984 again to compare.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>The original dystopian novel. Orwell was a fan and claimed it inspired him to write 1984.<br/><br/>I haven't read 1984 since high school, but what I appreciated about We more than 1984 was that it's less about an authoritarian government and more about a society that puts utility, rational behavior, and data as the ultimate means to advance society. The government in We is way less sinister than 1984 and you could really even argue that it's ultimate goal was the flourishing of the people under its rule. It's easy to denounce the overreach and crimes of Big Brother, but in a culture driven by rapidly advancing knowledge and sheer amounts of data, are we as willing to admit to ourselves that those will ultimately fail as our saviors as well?<br/><br/>Also, while it made parts of this book tough to follow, the jagged, frantic writing in parts really works well."

Not necessarily that it's less important or any less interesting, but Dostoevsky spends the first 200ish pages largely on character development.

There's no plot. The structure is strange. It's one of these things with lots of ambiguity and endless \"Wait, what is he actually trying to say here\" moments.<br/><br/>Cities are generally fascinating to me and I’ve read a handful of nonfiction books about them, but none of them have exemplified how cities play a part in our personal narratives, our relationship to the physical space of a city, and our relationship to each other better than this book."

      "my_review": "First read this about 5 years ago and it holds up pretty well to a re-read. <br/><br/>I think what I really like about this book is that, unlike a lot of stuff in the true crime genre, it's less about the whodunnit (you know from basically the first chapter) and more about developing the people who are involved. So often this kind of stuff tries hook you with emotions and preys on a desire to know juicy details (looking at you, Serial Season 1). <br/><br/>Capote does a great job of holding both the senselessness and harrowing nature of the murder and the humanity of the perpetrators without downplaying either. At the end of the book, you both realize that they absolutely deserve their fate, but you still care about them as people and empathize with the paths that led them to that point."

While Dostoevsky is a master at confronting the dark fringes of humanity lurking deep in the soul, Tolstoy prefers a more optimistic, life-affirming arena that never feels naive or artificial. These stories stories (though at least 2 of them could be considered novellas) are an awesome way of experiencing Tolstoy without having to commit to the marathon of Anna Karenina or War & Peace."

Sure, it resonates at the same frequency as the current zeitgeist, but seeing so many people use words like \"important\" and \"necessary\" is really baffling. <br/><br/>The thing about satire is that it can quickly become a one trick pony. This book does. Quickly. So instead of things like, oh, I don't know...plot...it's basically filled with a bunch of loud, raunchy jokes with some other stuff happening on the side. Which is fine for something like a standup comedy show, but not \"important\" and \"necessary\" books."

But I stuck with it and really ended up enjoying it (and the author did end up explaining everything...I think...). Like all the best sci-fi, it makes us ask questions about what it means to be human. Specifically, The Thing Itself deals with humans' search for objective truth with a consciousness that is anything but objective. Interestingly, Roberts (an atheist) says in the acknowledgements that his goal was to write a book making the case for why someone should believe in God, which I think is a really fascinating thought experiment."

Once you get started (and print out a character list explaining the relationship between the main characters), it's a phenomenal read that is pretty easy to get through, but still carries emotional weight. I always find it so fascinating that books written so long ago in a vastly different culture can still be so incredibly relevant. Sure, there's a bunch of stuff in War and Peace about the glory and future of \"Mother Russia\", but beneath all of that is a meditation on what motivates and moves humanity to action."

It's hard to separate the gritty bleakness of Pancake's writing with the tragic story of his life. <br/><br/>The real strength of these stories is how completely dialed in to the heartbeat of rural West Virginia Pancake is. There's always seems to be a standard set of ideals that accompany the songs and stories of Appalachia: the geography, moving away, coming back, the comfort of family, the pain of family, the people you grew up with, the woes of blue collar work, etc. All of these themes run through these stories, creating characters and settings that are honest and captivating.<br/><br/>"

There's a simplicity in it that doesn't sacrifice depth or quality of writing.

Still, Dostoevsky's brilliant insight into the inner workings of humanity is still there, and it's easy to see experiences that led to many of the themes he explores in his later works. Certain parts are also incredibly relevant to many of the conversations taking place about incarceration happening today."

Still think overall David Brooks does a pretty effective job of compiling an overall message, and he remains one of my favorite cultural commentators"

A handful of people I know who have reputable reading opinions claimed they didn't hate this.<br/><br/>So then why did I hate reading this? Why did I fall asleep repeatedly reading this? I typically love the \"haha it's not about what the title implies it's about\" genre. <br/><br/>This isn't about a creek. It's VERY obviously not about a creek. <br/><br/>But I'm not really sure what it's about. The only thing I really took away from this is that she probably knows about the classic folk song \"Wreck of the Old 97\" because she makes a pretty cool subtle reference to it. But that's really about it.<br/><br/>I bought the Kindle version of this so I'm going to be tempted to read it again in 2-3 years, so somebody please (seriously) tell me what I should try to get out of it next time."
